# Optimized ablation configuration for GPT-OSS-20B
# Generated from: gpt-oss-20b.measure
# Model type: MoE
# Best measurement layer: 15 (quality: 0.0025)
# Selected 12 layers for ablation (focused on high-quality peaks)
# Layer range: 11-20 (targeted selection)
#
# Optimization strategy:
#   - Core peak layers (15-17): scale=1.0 (highest quality)
#   - Secondary peak (13-14, 18-20): scale=0.8 (good quality)
#   - Early peak approach (11-12): scale=0.6 (moderate quality)
#   - Focused on actual signal quality peaks rather than broad coverage
#
# Top 5 layers by signal quality:
#   1. Layer 15: quality=0.0025, snr=0.1718, cosine=0.9852
#   2. Layer 14: quality=0.0023, snr=0.1656, cosine=0.9863
#   3. Layer 17: quality=0.0022, snr=0.1628, cosine=0.9867
#   4. Layer 16: quality=0.0020, snr=0.1579, cosine=0.9875
#   5. Layer 13: quality=0.0017, snr=0.1504, cosine=0.9886
