# Optimized ablation configuration for GLM-4-Air
# Generated from: glm4-air.refuse
# Model type: MoE
# Best measurement layer: 18 (quality: 0.0439)
# Selected 18 layers for ablation (focused on high-quality peaks)
# Layer range: 4-25 (targeted selection)
#
# Optimization strategy:
#   - Core peak layers (18-22): scale=2.5 (highest quality)
#   - Secondary peak (15-17, 23-25): scale=2.0 (good quality)
#   - Early layers (4-8): scale=1.5 (moderate quality)
#   - Focused on actual signal quality peaks rather than broad coverage
#
# Top 5 layers by signal quality:
#   1. Layer 18: quality=0.0439, snr=0.4418, cosine=0.9006
#   2. Layer 19: quality=0.0381, snr=0.4225, cosine=0.9098
#   3. Layer 20: quality=0.0369, snr=0.4172, cosine=0.9115
#   4. Layer 21: quality=0.0297, snr=0.3878, cosine=0.9233
#   5. Layer 22: quality=0.0296, snr=0.3888, cosine=0.9240
