# Optimized configuration for GLM-4.5-Air based on analysis results
# Model: /home/arli/models/GLM-4.5-Air
# Best layers identified: 18-22 (peak signal quality)
# Secondary layers: 15-17 (good signal quality)

model: /home/arli/models/GLM-4.5-Air
measurements: GLM.refuse
output: glm4-air-abliterated

# Ablation strategy based on analysis:
# - Layers 18-22 show highest signal quality (0.029-0.043)
# - Layer 18 has peak signal quality (0.0431) and lowest cosine similarity (0.9021)
# - Using layer 18 as primary measurement source for strongest effect
ablate:
  # Secondary tier: Layers 15-17 (moderate signal quality)
  - layer: 15
    measurement: 18  # Use layer 18's strong refusal signal
    scale: 1.0
    sparsity: 0.00
  - layer: 16
    measurement: 18
    scale: 1.0
    sparsity: 0.00
  - layer: 17
    measurement: 18
    scale: 1.0
    sparsity: 0.00
  
  # Primary tier: Layers 18-22 (highest signal quality)
  - layer: 18
    measurement: 18  # Self-measurement for strongest layer

  - layer: 19
    measurement: 18
    scale: 1.0

  # Extended range: Layers 23-25 (declining but still useful)
  - layer: 23
    measurement: 18

# Notes:
# 1. Layer 18 shows the strongest refusal signal (signal quality: 0.0431)
# 2. Using layer 18 as measurement source for all ablations
# 3. Scale reduced for later layers (23-25) due to weaker signal
# 4. Layers 0-14 show weak signal and are skipped
# 5. Layers 26+ show declining signal quality and high cosine similarity
# 6. For MoE models, this will ablate all expert down_proj weights automatically
#
# Conservative approach: Start with layers 18-22 only
# Aggressive approach: Include layers 15-25 as shown above
# 
# Adjust scale parameter (0.5-2.0) to fine-tune ablation strength:
# - scale: 0.5 = gentle ablation
# - scale: 1.0 = standard ablation (recommended)
# - scale: 1.5-2.0 = aggressive ablation
